Theorems:

  t1 = ConcyclicPoints: A, B, C, D
  t2 = ConcyclicPoints: C, D, E, F
  t3 = ConcyclicPoints: E, F, A, B
  t4 = ConcurrentLines: [A, B], [C, D], [E, F]
  n1 = ConcyclicPoints: A, B, C, E
  n2 = ParallelLines: [A, B], [C, D]

Implications:

 ({t1, t2, t3}, !n1, !n2) => t4
 ({t1, t2}, t4, !n1, !n2) => t3
