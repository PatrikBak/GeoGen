Theorems:

  t1 = ParallelLines: [B, C], [D, E]
  t2 = ParallelLines: [A, B], [F, D]
  t3 = ParallelLines: [A, C], [F, E]
  t4 = ConcurrentLines: [A, F], [B, D], [C, E]
  n1 = CollinearPoints: A, B, C
  n2 = CollinearPoints: D, E, F
  n3 = CollinearPoints: B, C, D

Implications:

 ({t1, t2, t3}, !n1, !n2) => t4
 ({t1, t2}, t4, !n1, !n2) => t3
