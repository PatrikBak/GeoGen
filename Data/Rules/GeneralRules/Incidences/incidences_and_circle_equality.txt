Theorems:

 t1 = Incidence: Point(A), Circle(k)
 t2 = Incidence: Point(B), Circle(k)
 t3 = Incidence: Point(C), Circle(k)
 t4 = Incidence: Point(A), Circle(l)
 t5 = Incidence: Point(B), Circle(l)
 t6 = Incidence: Point(C), Circle(l)
 t7 = EqualObjects: k, l

Implications:

 ({t1, t2, t3}, {t4, t5, t6}) => t7
